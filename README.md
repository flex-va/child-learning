Children's Privacy Policy
Our Company, Flex Tech, is committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) to protect the personal information of children under 13 years of age. This policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard information for our Children Learning App.
# Collection of Personal Information
We do not collect any personal information from children, such as the child's name, age, or email address. Our app is strictly for learning purposes and does not require any personal information to use it.
However, our app displays advertisements through Google Admobs. We have selected the appropriate category of Google Admobs for child learning, but the ads may still collect non-personal information, such as device type, IP address, and location. These ads are displayed anonymously, and we do not have access to any personal information collected by Google Admobs.
# Usage of Information
Our app collects anonymous information about the child's progress and performance, such as their score, time spent on each activity, and the types of activities they engage in. We use this information to improve the functionality and content of the app, to better serve our users. This information is only used in the aggregate and is not linked to any personal information.
# Data Storage and Security
We take the protection of information collected from our users, including children, seriously. All data collected by our app is securely stored on our servers, and access is strictly limited to authorized personnel. We use reasonable measures to safeguard against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of the information we collect.
# Third-party Services
Our app uses Google Admobs for the display of advertisements. Google Admobs is a third-party service that may collect non-personal information such as the device type, IP address, and location of the user to display relevant ads. We have selected the appropriate category of Google Admobs for child learning. However, we do not have control over the privacy practices of Google Admobs or any other third-party services that our app may link to. We encourage parents to review the privacy policies of these services before allowing their child to use our app.
# Contact Information
If you have any questions or concerns about our Children's Privacy Policy or the use of our app, please contact us at flexstore.contact@gmail.com. We are committed to maintaining the privacy and security of information collected from our users, including children, and will respond to inquiries within a reasonable time frame.
# Updates to this Policy
We may update this policy from time to time to reflect changes in our information practices or changes in applicable laws. We encourage you to check this policy periodically for any updates or changes.
By providing clear and comprehensive information about how the app collects and uses information, we aim to help parents feel confident that their child's privacy is protected while using our Children Learning App.
